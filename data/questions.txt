Category A — Conceptual → Source-specific escalation
(Baseline memory effect)
1. What is parametric memory? 
   Expected planner behavior: noop
2. What is parametric memory according to Attention Is All You Need?
   Expected planner behavior: retrieve

Category B — Repeated conceptual question after retrieval
(Working memory visibility, not persistence)
1. Summarize the difference between parametric and non-parametric memory.
   Expected planner behavior: likely retrieve
2. Explain that difference again, briefly.
   Expected planner behavior: WM contains -> planner thought, executor step, used_retrieval = True.
   Planner decision may still be retrieve or noop — either is fine

What we are evaluating:
    WM correctly captures what just happened
    WM resets next run

Category C — Cross-run state forcing (your negative constraint)
(This is where memory causes a suboptimal action)
1. What does RAG mean in large language models?
   Expected planner behavior: retrieve
2. What is RAG?
   Expected planner behavior: retrieve, even though it could answer parametrically
